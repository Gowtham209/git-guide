# Git Guide

## Git init

Command used to create a **"New Local Project (Repo)"** without any Remote Repo connection. It's essentially the "brain" and "memory" of the project.

> **NOTE:** Creates `.git` folder which tracks every single change we make in that directory.



Git Level

Beginner:
    Creating Fresh project in Local vs Cloning from Remote Repo

    Adding files (Staging)

    Commiting those Files (Taking snapshot)

    If Fresh:
        Need to Config a Connection inbetween Remote and Local Repo

        Need to Set Upstream to Remote Repo

    Else If Cloned:
        All the Connection are Pre-config So can Push Directly


InterMediate:
    Updating Local Git Repo by making sure all the Remote Repo changes also Present in Local

    Merging the Remote Changes with Local
        If Conflict:
            Manually Choose which is Kept and Which is Not kept
    
    Creating New Branch and Using it as new Project


Professional:
    Empty Commit
    Difference between Squash & Stach 
    Difference between Revert & Reset
    diff
    Peeking the Staging 
    -m vs -M
    -d vs -D
